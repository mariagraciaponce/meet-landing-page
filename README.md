## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I started doing the mobile design and worked towards tablet and desktop design. Centering divs is the thing that I usually struggle the most and this challenge was no exception but whit grid and flexbox I was able to do it, also I learned that I can center a div with "margin: 0 auto;" if I have it on "display:block" and a specific width, that information was really helpfull.

### Continued development

I really want to focus on mastering the :root element of my style.css file. I know that I could save myself a lot of coding if a have preset features there. 
Also this is the first challenge that I do with Figma designs. I want to continue exploring the app and understanding it.
